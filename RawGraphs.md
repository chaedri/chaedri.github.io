# Visualizations Made with RawGraphs.io
As part of [Professor Laura Tateosian's Geovisualization course](https://wolfware.ncsu.edu/courses/details/?sis_id=SIS:2020:1:1:GIS:715:001), we've been learning different tools and software packages for creating visualizations with attractive, color-blind-friendly color ramps and palettes. In a recent lab, we focused on RawGraphs.io](https://rawgraphs.io/), a simple, web-based application that will take you from CSV to attractive visualization in less than 5 minutes. Here are a few examples we made in lab. 

## Orchestra Treemap
This treemap is from a tutorial offered by RawGraphs showing the size and composition of four different orchestras.

## Invasive Species Bumpchart
This bumpchart shows the number of alien species first records by continent. The data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3690742#.YEu0sZ1KhPa) but we were introduced to it by our classmate Ariel Saffer.

## Fall Semester Time Usage Streamplot
Last semester, I kept track of how I split my time between coursework, research, email and zoom using a desktop app called [Toggl](https://toggl.com/). I was hoping it will help me create a sense of work-life balance in the work-from-home, zoom-athon that is our new Pandemic normal. To test RawGraphs on some of my own data, I made a streamplot showing how I split my time. The width of the lines shows how much relative time I spent on a given task per day. I left the Y-axis unlabed so you all can't judge how long I do or don't spend working. You can see I worked less on weekends until finals came around. In the middle of the semester, we had a Data Mining 4-day Data Challenge that took up a lot of time. You can also see how I  started the semester with lofty research goals but by the third week, I realized I didn't have time to do research and a full course load.
